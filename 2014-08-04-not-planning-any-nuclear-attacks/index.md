title: I am not planning any nuclear attacks

I recently wrote about a strange phone call that I received from the letting agents in charge of the house I live in. They’d recently carried out a routine visual inspection of the house, and were concerned about my whiteboard diagrams for a game idea I’d been working on.

The phone call ended amicably, and seemed like it put their mind at rest. I thought I’d heard the end of the matter. I was wrong. Today, they emailed me informing me that they’ve referred the matter to the local police.

Understandably, being reported to the police as a suspected nuclear terrorist has come as something of a shock to me. So in the spirit of “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear”, here is what was on the whiteboards when they did their inspection.
