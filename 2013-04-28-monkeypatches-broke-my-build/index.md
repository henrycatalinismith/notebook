The prevalence of monkey patching as a Ruby development practice is a complete pain in the arse.
Sure, some of Ruby's expressiveness as a tool for building DSLs is derived from the ability to monkey patch things like 10.days.ago into the core classes.
Admittedly, I occasionally indulge my sweet tooth at the Rails all-you-can-eat syntactic sugar buffet.
But it's not my favourite approach to software development by a long shot.

A couple of months ago I wrote a little about the general awkwardness resulting from monkey patching.
I've been burnt worse since then, and now I have a concrete example which I think supports my point of view quite strongly.

## Coveralls/Colorized/Colored Clusterfuck

Today I wanted to add a service called Coveralls to ppl's build process.
Coveralls measures test coverage, provides statistics about test coverage over time, and supplies a dynamic README badge for advertising your project's commitment to thorough testing.
It's a perfect fit for a project like ppl, so I was keen to get it running.

Take a quick look at the commit which added Coveralls to ppl.
It's a tiny commit, and seemingly harmless.
To my great surprise, it broke the build on Travis CI.
And which test did it break?

```
Failures:

1) Ppl::Format::Table#to_s should colorize columns if requested
    Failure/Error: @table.to_s.should eq "\e[31m12345  \e[0m\e[33mJohn Doe  \e[0m\e[34mjdoe@example.org  \e[0m"

    expected: "\e[31m12345  \e[0m\e[33mJohn Doe  \e[0m\e[34mjdoe@example.org  \e[0m"
         got: "\e[0;31;49m12345  \e[0m\e[0;33;49mJohn Doe  \e[0m\e[0;34;49mjdoe@example.org  \e[0m"

    (compared using ==)
# ./spec/ppl/format/table_spec.rb:80:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

The design of that test is actually a bit of a minor mistake on my part.
The color adapter probably ought to be mocked out, as this test isn't really about the ANSI color escape codes themselves.

On the plus side, this has exposed something very interesting: the escape codes surrounding the strings have changed subtly.
And why is that? Because the Coveralls gem depends on a string colorization library called colorize.
When Coveralls is loaded by the line require "coveralls", colorize's String class monkey patches overwrite the ones previously made by Ppl::Adapter::Color::Colored when it loads the colored gem.

## What. The. Fuck.

Did you catch that? My project's test suite failed because one of Coveralls' dependencies changed the behaviour of Ruby's core String class in a way that overwrites changes previously made to that class by a dependency of ppl.
This is absolute insanity.
It's not even anybody's fault, but rather an inevitable consequence of monkey patching.

I'm quite new to Ruby, so I have to rely on others for perspective on this approach to Ruby development.
Judging by Avdi Grimm's 2008 post, "Monkeypatching is Destroying Ruby", it was considered quite hip five years ago.
Here we are in 2013, and installing a code coverage tool has literally changed the output of my code.
It's pretty clear that Avdi was right, anyway.

Refinements look set to right some of these wrongs, but Ruby 2.0 is still warm from the oven, and projects like ppl will probably be supporting 1.9 for a long time to come.
In the meantime, I've decided to start treating monkey patches more or less like a code smell.
Not because they are necessarily fragile in themselves, but because of the fragility they so inscrutably create in other code.
